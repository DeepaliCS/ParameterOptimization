## ParamterOptimization
# About
Parameter optimisation of the angle and distance a canon should shoot in order to reach the given target of combat.

Different range of datasets were tests to create a minimum spanning tree, and the algorithms were used to find the quickest way possible from point A to point B

## Creation Info
The project was created in Eclipse IDE, written in Java.

## Hill Climing
The standard Hill Climbing optimization algorithm was used in order to optmize the predicted results of what possible angle and velocity inputs were required to hit the target.

## Conclustion
Different iterations were conducted based on algorithm performace, epoch increments, and other comparisons. All charts are available to view on the spreadsheets 1-4.

## Usage
This was a research project, feel free to fork and explore.
